Kaushal: Some files that are too big to be uploaded onto Github (e.g. expression matrices, etc.) are at at the following links. I have tried to keep the directory structure the same as that present in my directory on Github, so that anyone can just download the files into their local Git project directory with the same directory structure. This way, the relative paths in the code files are consistent for anyone on the repository.
